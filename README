Programming Assignment 3

                                                List.h 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Provides function prototypes, parameter details, and function return types of the List ADT to the client. 
Briefly explains each functions' purpose and use cases.

                                                List.c 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implements the functions of the List ADT. Handles invalid and/or empty inputs appropriately. 
Defines the functionality of the tools provided by the List ADT
List ADT is a doubly linked list that provides client side users access to functions that can generate dynamically allocated lists.
These lists' data can be accessed and modified through the various function calls provided and listed in the List.h file. 

                                                Graph.h
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------z--------------------------------------------
Provides function prototypes, parameter details, and function types of the Graph ADT to the client.
Briefly explains how each function can be used and use cases for each function.

                                                Graph.c
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implements the functions of the Graph ADT and handles invalid, and out of bounds inputs appropriately.
Defines functionality to the tools provided by the Graph ADT.
Graph ADT is a tool that lets clients algorithmically arrange given data into an 
adjacency list representation of a undirected or directed graph.
Along with this, the client is also given the tools necessary to find distances and paths from a source vertex to a desired destination.
Graph ADT uses the Breadth First Search Algorithm to find fastest paths from a set location to a desired destination.
Its data can be accessed and modified through the function calls listed in Graph.h
This set of functionality is provided and briefly explained in Graph.h.

                                                GraphTest.c
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GraphTest is a program that tests the functions created for the Graph ADT in an environment that's both optimal and non-optimal.
Consider it a stress test for every operation built in the Graph ADT.

                                                FindComponents.c
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arguments: infile , outfile

FindComponents.c is a program that displays the adjacency list representation of a created Digraph using a given input file. This input 
file should contain the size of the Graph as its first line and the arcs from vertex to vertex in the following lines. After this process
has completed, the program calculates the strongly connected components of the Digraph. It does this by generating a stack from a first
DFS call on the existing graph. After, the program runs DFS a second time in the order of the modified Stack using the original Graph's
transpose. Through this algorithm, we get the strongly connected components in groups in our newly modified stack, separated by NIL
parent vertices.

                                                Makefile
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Provides easier command line expressions that make it easier to build and run each of the client side programs.
